How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

Viewing the diff of the two files made finding the bug easier because it 
allowed me to ignore everything that was the same. Anything that is the same 
could not be the source of the bug and therefore is just a distraction from 
finding the actual location of the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows you to experiment without worrying about ruining a working version 
since you can go back to a working version if the experiment does not work out.
It would also allow you to get a better understanding of a section of code by 
seeing how it has changed over time.
